	Switch is a button with two states: on and off. It's

	to turn on or off some functionality of the application,
	i.e. in settings menu.

	Switch can has four states. Main states are two: AcceptedUncheck
	and AcceptedCheck. The difference between not accepted and accepted
	states is that that, for example, user can toggle button with a finger
	to the checked state but application needs some time to turn of the
	functionality conjugated with this button. And while this functionality
	will not be turned on and setState() will not be
	called button will be in the NotAcceptedCheck state. In this state button
	will be turned on but will not be highlighted, that tell the user that
	his action is in process. When application is done with turning on
	the conjugated functionality programmaticaly should be called setState()
	slot with AcceptedCheck as argument. And at this point Switch will
	highlight his checked state.
